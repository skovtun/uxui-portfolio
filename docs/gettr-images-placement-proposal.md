## Proposed Image Placement Structure

### **Section 1: Results (After Solution)**
*Show final outcomes first — following "Result First" pattern from Empower*

**Placement:** Immediately after Solution section

**Images:**
1. **`gettr-web-1.png`**
   - Primary web interface result
2. **`gettr-web-4.png`**
   - Additional web interface view
3. **`gettr-web-2.png`**
   - Secondary web interface view
4. **`gettr-web-3.png`**
   - Additional web interface view
5. **`gettr-mobile-ui.png`**
   - Mobile interface result

**Rationale:** Following the "Result First" narrative pattern, showing final outcomes early demonstrates impact before diving into process details.

---

### **Section 2: Research & Analysis (After Approach)**
*Support the research and analysis steps mentioned in Approach*

**Placement:** After Approach section, before Design System

**Images:**
1. **`gettr-research.png`**
   - User behavior analysis, competitive benchmarking
2. **`gettr-ux-research.png`**
   - UX research documentation, user insights
3. **`gettr-wireframes.png`**
   - Wireframe exploration (300+ wireframes mentioned)
4. **`gettr-wireframes-2.png`**
   - Additional wireframe sets

**Rationale:** These images directly support the Approach section points about user behavior analysis, competitive benchmarking, and wireframing (300+ wireframes).

---

### **Section 3: Design System (Separate Section)**
*Show design system architecture and evolution*

**Placement:** After Research & Analysis, before Impact

**Images:**
1. **`gettr-ui-kit.png`**

## Final Decisions Made

1. **Image Selection:**
   - ✅ Using `gettr-web-1.png` and `gettr-web-4.png` in Results section
   - ✅ Excluding `gettr-logos.png` and `gettr-promo.png` (not relevant for product design case study)
   - ✅ Excluding `gettr-web-1-1.png` (using gettr-web-1.png instead)

2. **Placement Strategy:**
   - ✅ Following "Result First" pattern (like Empower)
   - ✅ Wireframes grouped together in Research & Analysis section

3. **Caption Detail Level:**
   - ✅ Captions reference specific numbers (42 flows, 300+ wireframes) where relevant
   - ✅ Captions align with FAANG-level case study standards

4. **Design System Emphasis:**
   - ✅ Design system images placed after Research & Analysis, before Impact
   - ✅ Placement demonstrates progression: Results → Process → Infrastructure

## Team Assessment

### **Recommended Approach:**
Following the pattern established in Empower and 1inch case studies, we recommend:

1. **Results First** - Show final outcomes early to demonstrate impact
2. **Process Second** - Show research and wireframes to demonstrate depth
3. **System Third** - Show design system to demonstrate infrastructure thinking

### **Image Sequence Recommendation:**
1. Web interfaces (Results) - 3-4 images
2. Mobile interface (Results) - 1 image
3. Research documentation (Process) - 2 images
4. Wireframes (Process) - 2 images
5. Design system (Infrastructure) - 2-3 images

**Total: 12 images** (excluding logos and promo)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review image content** - Need to see actual images to refine captions
2. **Confirm placement** - Validate sequence with team
3. **Refine captions** - Ensure they align perfectly with case study narrative
4. **Implement** - Add images to CaseStudyContent.tsx following approved structure

## Notes for ChatGPT Review

When reviewing this proposal, please consider:

1. **Narrative Flow:** Does the image sequence support a Senior-level story of system thinking + execution?
2. **FAANG Standards:** Are captions appropriately detailed without being verbose?
3. **Credibility:** Do captions avoid overclaiming while demonstrating depth?
4. **Visual Storytelling:** Does the sequence show progression from problem → research → solution → system?
5. **Missing Elements:** Are there gaps in visual evidence that should be addressed?

## Alternative Considerations

### **Option A: Process-First Narrative**
- Research & Wireframes first
- Design System second
- Results last

**Pros:** Shows thinking process, demonstrates depth
**Cons:** Delays impact demonstration

### **Option B: Hybrid Approach**
- Key Result (1-2 images) early
- Process (research, wireframes)
- Design System
- Additional Results

**Pros:** Balances impact and process
**Cons:** May feel less structured

### **Current Recommendation: Result-First (Option C)**
- Results first (4 images)
- Process second (4 images)
- System third (2-3 images)

**Pros:** Immediate impact, then depth, then infrastructure
**Cons:** None significant
