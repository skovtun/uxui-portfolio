## 2. Critical Gaps for FAANG Standards ⚠️

### 2.1 Missing Quantitative Impact Metrics

**Current State:**
- Impact statements are qualitative: "Improved UI consistency", "Increased development speed"
- No specific numbers, percentages, or business metrics
- Missing user behavior data (engagement, conversion, retention)

**FAANG Expectation:**
- Quantified business impact (e.g., "Reduced support tickets by 40%", "Increased conversion by 23%")
- User metrics (DAU, retention, task completion rates)
- Engineering efficiency metrics (shipping speed, bug reduction)

**Recommendations:**
1. **Add metrics to each case study:**
   - Empower: "Reduced design-to-development handoff time by 60%", "Decreased UI inconsistencies by 85%"
   - 1inch: "Reduced transaction abandonment by 35%", "Increased mobile engagement by 28%"
   - Social Platform: Already has "25% increase in DAU" - good! Add more.

2. **Create a "Metrics Dashboard" section** showing key achievements across projects

3. **Use before/after comparisons** with specific numbers

### 2.2 Insufficient User Research & Data-Driven Decisions

**Current State:**
- Limited mention of user research methodology
- No user testing results or insights
- Missing data-driven decision-making process

**FAANG Expectation:**
- Clear research methodology (interviews, surveys, usability testing, analytics)
- User insights that drove design decisions
- A/B testing results or experimentation
- Data synthesis and how it informed design

**Recommendations:**
1. **Add "Research & Insights" section** to each case study:
   - User interviews: "Conducted 12 user interviews revealing..."
   - Analytics: "Data showed 40% of users dropped off at..."
   - Usability testing: "5/8 participants failed to complete task X, leading to..."

2. **Show the "Why" behind design decisions** with data backing

3. **Include user quotes or personas** to humanize the research

### 2.3 Limited Strategic & Business Thinking

**Current State:**

- ROI of design investments

**Recommendations:**
1. **Add "Business Impact" section** to each case study:
   - How the design supported business goals (revenue, growth, efficiency)
   - Strategic decisions made (e.g., "Prioritized X feature because it addressed Y business need")
   - Long-term product vision considerations

2. **Show product thinking**, not just design execution:
   - "I identified that feature X would solve problem Y, which would increase retention by Z%"
   - "I advocated for design system investment because it would reduce shipping time by 40%"

3. **Add a "Strategic Design" section** showing how you think about product strategy

### 2.4 Missing Process & Methodology Details

   - Process diagrams or flowcharts

2. **Add "Design System Governance" case study** showing:
   - How you established design system processes
   - Component contribution guidelines
   - Quality standards and review process
   - Adoption strategies across teams

### 2.5 Limited Problem-Solution Narrative

**Current State:**
- Problems are stated but not deeply explored
- Missing "why this problem matters" context
- Solution connection to problem could be stronger

**FAANG Expectation:**
- Deep problem exploration (root cause analysis)
- Multiple solution options considered
- Trade-off analysis and decision rationale
- Iterative refinement based on feedback

**Recommendations:**
1. **Expand "Problem" sections** with:
   - Root cause analysis: "The issue wasn't just X, but underlying problem Y"
   - Impact quantification: "This problem cost the company $X in support tickets"
   - User pain points with specific examples

2. **Add "Solution Exploration" section**:
   - 2-3 alternative solutions considered
   - Trade-offs evaluated (time, complexity, user value)
   - Why the chosen solution was selected

3. **Show iteration**: "Initial solution had issue X, so we iterated to Y based on user feedback"

### 2.6 Missing Leadership & Influence Evidence

**Current State:**
- Collaboration mentioned but leadership unclear
- No mentorship or team growth examples
- Missing design culture or process improvements

**FAANG Expectation:**
