## STEP 1: EXTRACT & AUDIT

### Current Case Study Text (Full)

#### Hero Summary
**Title:** Empower  
**Subtitle:** Design Systems & UI for a Large-Scale Financial Platform  
**Year:** 2024 — now

#### Overview
"Designed and scaled a unified design system and core product UI for Empower — a large-scale financial platform providing tools for personal finance, retirement planning, and wealth management for both individual users and enterprise retirement plans."

#### Context
"Empower operated a legacy corporate website and core financial application supported by an outdated UI kit that lacked consistency, scalability, and clear system rules."

#### Problem
"When I joined the team, the product relied on an outdated UI and a fragmented UI kit that did not scale well across teams or platforms."

#### Key Issues
- "Lack of a single, shared design system across products"
- "Visual and behavioral inconsistencies between similar components"
- "Frequent design drift caused by ad-hoc modifications"
- "Friction between design and engineering due to unclear or inconsistent specifications"
- "Limited ability to scale UI efficiently as the product evolved"
- "These problems impacted development velocity, UI quality, and long-term maintainability."

#### Role & Ownership
**Role:** Senior UX/UI Designer

**Ownership:**
- "End-to-end design system architecture (components, tokens, patterns)"
- "Data-dense UI components (tables, dashboards, charts, complex layouts)"
- "Navigation structure and interaction models"
- "High-fidelity design and responsive layouts (desktop, tablet, mobile)"
- "Design quality, consistency, and scalability across products"
- "Design-to-development handoff and implementation alignment"
- "Design guidelines and system adoption across teams"

**Collaboration:**
- "Product Managers (strategy alignment, feature prioritization, business impact measurement)"
- "Frontend Engineers (component architecture, implementation patterns, technical feasibility)"
- "Design peers (design reviews, system governance, mentorship of junior designers)"
- "Design System Council (established governance process with 5 senior designers)"
- "Product Teams (adoption support, training sessions for 20+ designers across 3 product areas)"

#### Solution
"Designed and scaled a unified design system for Empower's corporate website and core financial application. Focused on reusable components, consistent UI patterns, and clear data-heavy interfaces to support complex financial workflows across teams and products."

#### Approach
- "Conducted comprehensive UI audit across 200+ screens and 150+ components, identifying 40+ inconsistency patterns and documenting pain points"
- "Interviewed 8 designers and 5 engineers to understand technical constraints, workflow challenges, and adoption barriers"
- "Designed scalable design system architecture with 50+ reusable components, comprehensive design tokens, and interaction patterns"
- "Built interactive Figma prototypes with component variants and states for validation with engineering teams"
- "Established design review process with weekly syncs with engineering leads and monthly design system council meetings"
- "Created comprehensive documentation, component library, and onboarding materials for design system adoption"
- "Iterated through 3 major versions based on team feedback, usage analytics, and evolving product needs"
- "Design decisions were made collaboratively, balancing consistency, reusability, technical feasibility, and long-term maintainability"

#### Impact
- "Reduced design-to-development handoff time from 2 weeks to 3 days (60% reduction) through standardized components and clear specifications"
- "Design system adoption enabled 40% faster feature shipping across 5 product teams, supporting company goal of 2x product velocity"
- "Eliminated 80% of UI inconsistency bugs through standardized components and design tokens"
- "Saved 15+ hours/week per designer through reusable component library (50+ components), enabling focus on product strategy"
- "Improved design-engineering alignment, reducing rework by 65% and increasing implementation accuracy"
- "Established design governance process adopted by 20+ designers across 3 product areas, ensuring long-term system quality"

#### Reflection
"This project reinforced my experience designing at a system level — balancing product requirements, engineering constraints, and long-term scalability while maintaining a high standard of visual and interaction quality across a complex financial platform. Leading the design system initiative required not just design skills, but strategic thinking, cross-functional influence, and the ability to drive adoption across multiple teams. The measurable impact on development velocity and design quality validated the strategic importance of investing in foundational design infrastructure. This experience taught me that great design systems are not just collections of components, but strategic enablers that unlock team productivity and product quality at scale."

#### Areas of Emphasis
- "Product Design (UX/UI)"
- "Complex Dashboards & Data-heavy interfaces"
- "Design Systems & UI Kits"
- "FinTech"
- "Cross-functional collaboration"

   - If exact number unknown, use "50+ components" or range like "40-60 components"

2. **Team/Designer count:** Can you confirm:
   - Number of product teams using the system? (Currently: "5 product teams")
   - Number of designers using the system? (Currently: "20+ designers")
   - Number of product areas? (Currently: "3 product areas")

## STEP 3: FAANG SIGNALS CHECKLIST

### ✅ Already Present:
- [x] System thinking (design system architecture)
- [x] Scale (multiple teams, platforms, components)
- [x] Leadership (governance, mentorship, adoption)
- [x] Cross-functional collaboration (PM, Eng, Design)
- [x] Process depth (audit, interviews, iterations)

## STEP 4: REVISED CASE STUDY (DRAFT)

*Will be finalized after receiving answers to hard facts questions*

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Wait for hard facts answers** (or proceed with conservative defaults)
2. **Generate final calibrated copy** with both versions
3. **Create claim defensibility table**
4. **Create FAANG readiness checklist**
5. **Final review and polish**
